<h1><a class="anchor" id="sOver"></a>
Overview</h1>
<p>The model describes the development of a community of perennial plant functional types (PFTs). It is based on the grassland model developed by May et al. (2009), augmented by the incorporation of clonal plant types. The model is individual-based and spatially explicit. It includes the entities seeds, individual plants and grid cells. Seeds are characterized by their spatial position and the state variables mass and age. Individual plants, which are either ramets in the case of clonal plant types or non-clonal individuals, are described by their position, shoot, root and reproductive mass, the number of ramets within a genet in case of clonal plant types and the duration of resource stress exposure (Table S1); additionally, 22 parameters define the plant&amp;primes functional type (Table S2). The model simulates an area of approx. 3 square meters, i.e. a grid of 173*173 cells representing 1 square cm each. Each cell can be occupied by the stemming point of one individual plant only, but the individuals&amp;prime zone of influence can cover more than one grid cell (see below). A time step corresponds to one week, simulation time is 100 years with a vegetation period of 30 weeks per year. Fig. 1 shows the scheduling of sub-models that are run for each individual plant, which are briefly explained in the following:</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="scomp"></a>
Resource competition</h1>
<p>Individual plants gain resources on their zone of influence (ZOI), a circular area around their stemming location (Schwinning and Weiner 1998, Weiner et al. 2001). To independently represent above- and belowground competition, plants have an above- and belowground ZOI (Fig. S1). The ZOIs&amp;prime radius depends on the mass of the corresponding plant compartment. Thus, as plants grow their ZOIs grow and start to overlap with ZOIs of neighboring plants. On the overlapping areas, plants compete for resources, i.e. resources are shared according to relative competitive abilities.</p>
<p>For above-ground competition, size-asymmetric competition is assumed, i.e. larger and higher plants receive a higher share of resources in proportion to their shoot geometry traits (plant mass and growth form), while belowground competition is assumed to be size-symmetric, i.e. resources are partitioned equally between individuals (Schwinning and Weiner 1998, Weiner et al. 2001).</p>
<p>Intra- versus interspecific competitive effects are included into the model by considering individuals of the same PFT as con- and of different PFTs as hetero-specifics. The relative competitive ability of a plant is higher the less con-specific individuals cover the same cell. Thereby intra-specific competition is increased relatively to interspecific competition, implicating niche differentiation of resource competition (Chesson 2000).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sgrowth"></a>
Plant growth</h1>
<p>Plant growth depends on the resources an individual plant acquires in its ZOIs. Resources are adaptively allocated to shoot and root growth in order to balance the uptake of the limiting above- or belowground resources. Maximal resource allocation to growth is limited by a PFT-specific maximal resource utilization rate. Growth of reproductive biomass takes place in weeks 16 to 20 each year. </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="sdisp"></a>
Seed dispersal</h1>
<p>Seeds of all plants are dispersed in week 21 each year. The number of seeds dispersed by an individual plant is calculated by dividing its reproductive biomass by the type-specific mass of one seed (Schippers et al. 2001, Lehsten and Kleyer 2007). Dispersal distance and direction are chosen stochastically from a log-normal (distance) or respectively uniform (direction) distribution (Stoyan and Wagner 2001). </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="smort"></a>
Mortality</h1>
<p>If resource uptake is below a fixed threshold fraction of the optimal resource uptake of a plant, it suffers from resource stress. The probability of dying increases linearly with each week of stress exposure. A PFT-specific maximal survival time under resource stress determines death of a plant. Additionally, a constant background mortality of 0.7% per week, corresponding to 20% annual mortality (Schippers et al. 2001), is assumed. At the end of each year, 50 % of all seeds die randomly due to winter mortality. Also, there is a winter dieback of 50% of above-ground biomass of all plants. </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="sgraz"></a>
Grazing</h1>
<p>Grazing takes place randomly during the vegetation period with a fixed weekly probability. Individual plants affected by grazing are chosen randomly, with a probability that depends on its traits shoot size, growth form and a PFT-specific palatability. A grazing event corresponds to a reduction of shoot mass of 50% and the removal of its entire reproductive biomass. Plants are chosen randomly until 50 % of the above-ground biomass on the grid is removed. </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="sestab"></a>
Establishment</h1>
<p>Seeds germinate and establish during four weeks after dispersal (autumn) and four weeks in spring of the next growing season. Only one seedling per cell is allowed to establish (with shoot and root mass equal to seed mass). The respective seedling is the winner of a weighted lottery competition between seedlings in one cell, with seed mass being the measure for competitive ability of the seedlings (Chesson and Warner 1981, Schippers et al. 2001). </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="sclon"></a>
Clonal growth and resource sharing</h1>
<p>Clonal plant growth is integrated via the ability of individuals to propagate vegetatively (growth, dispersion and establishment of spacers) and a PFT-specific ability to share resources between ramets of one genet. Here we assume that for each individual (i.e. ramet) one spacer can grow at a time step. Analogously to generative reproduction, 5% of acquired resources are allocated to the growth of the spacer. The length of spacers is randomly chosen from a PFT-specific normal distribution. Direction of spacer growth is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>At the end of the vegetation period, all spacers of clonal individuals establish unless the cell they have reached by that time is occupied by the center of a different individual. If this is the case, the spacer is removed from the grid.</p>
<p>Clonal plants of the integrator-type (sensu Oborny et al. 2000) share resources throughout the whole genet, i.e. resources that are not essential for survival of the ramets are provided for the genet and subsequently equally shared among ramets. </p>

Initialization</h1>
<p>Ten seedlings of each of the 86 PFT (see below) are randomly distributed over the grid. Resources are spatially and temporally distributed homogenously in the simulations. </p>

Trait syndromes and clonal attributes</h1>
<p>Each plant in the model belongs to a certain plant functional type (PFT), which differ in their attributes, or parameters, for four functional trait syndromes that are based on well-documented trade-offs, and two clonal attributes (Tables S1 and S2): </p>
<dl class="section see"><dt>See Also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="class_s_pft_traits.html">SPftTraits</a></dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ssgf"></a>
Growth form</h2>
<p>The ratio between leaf mass and total shoot mass characterizes the growth form of a plant. Low values indicate that plants invest more resources in building up support tissue instead of leaves. Hence, the leaf/mass ratio reflects a trade-off between above-ground competitive ability (for light) and the relative growth rate of a plant without competition.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ssmaxplant"></a>
Maximum plant mass</h2>
<p>Maximum plant mass comprises attributes that reflect the competition colonization trade-off. Maximum plant mass is positively correlated with individual seed mass (Eriksson and Jakobsson 1998), and hence negatively correlated with seed number and dispersal distance. PFTs with low seed masses produce more seeds per resources gained for reproduction (Leishman 2001, Schippers et al. 2001) and these seeds disperse over longer distances (Jongejans and Schippers 1999). However, PFTs with high seed masses experience higher recruitment success (see Establishment section).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ssres"></a>
Resource response</h2>
<p>The trade-off between competitive ability and stress tolerance (Grime 2001) is integrated in the trait syndrome \“resource response\”. A high relative growth rate in resource-rich environments comes along with low stress resistance, i.e. a short period a plant can survive under resource stress.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sspalat"></a>
Grazing response</h2>
<p>Response to grazing can follow two strategies: tolerance by fast re-growth or avoidance by a low palatability (Bullock et al. 2001). We use a functional analogue to the specific leaf area (SLA) to characterize the trade-off between high longevity, structural strength or high allocation to defensive compounds (low SLA, low palatability) and fast growth through high efficiency of light interception (high SLA, high palatability) (Westoby et al. 2002).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ssclonality"></a>
Clonal attributes</h2>
<p>Clonal plants are characterized by the potential of sharing resources between ramets via persistent connective tissues (Oborny et al. 2000) and the trade-off between number and length of spacers between ramets (Winkler et al. 2002).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="spftdef"></a>
Definition of plant functional types</h1>
<p>Within the 'Biodiversity Exploratories', experimental plots of semi-natural grasslands are monitored (Fischer et al. 2010). A total number of 197 perennial herbaceous plant species found on the plots, used as pastures, were classified into PFTs via traits listed in the trait databases LEDA (Kleyer et al. 2008), BiolFlor (Klotz et al. 2002) and Clo-Pla3 (Klimesova and De Bello, 2009). Classification into PFTs was conducted by characterizing these species by the trait syndromes defined in the model as follows (see Table 1 for trait parameters and a complete list of plant species and respective traits in Supplementary Material):</p>
<p>The Growth form of a species was defined as rosette, semi-rosette or erect by using the \“rosettes\” attribute from the database BiolFlor. The Resource response strategy (competitor, intermediate or stress tolerator type) of a species was classified following Grime (1974, 1979) by applying the \“ecological strategy\” attribute from BiolFlor. Species\´ Grazing response strategies (tolerator, intermediate, and avoider) were also extracted from BiolFlor by using the attribute \“grazing tolerance\” from the trait group \“grassland utilization indicator value\”. The Maximum plant size of a species (large, medium, and small) was obtained from the trait \“seed release height\” of the LEDA-database by classifying three equidistantly spaced levels. Seed release height was used rather than canopy height, as it is more closely correlated to seed mass (REF), which is the relevant parameter in the model. The clonal attributes Spacer length and integration were derived from the CloPla3 database.</p>
<p>If more than one database entry was available for a species, we selected for completeness, provenance (Central European records preferred) and habitat type. Furthermore clonal attributes were selected for the clonal growth organ with maximal lateral spread per year. Clonal integration was approved if connective tissues between mother and daughter ramets persist for two or more years while species with connective tissues persisting less than two years are assumed not to share resources within the individual. Spacer length was grouped via the \“lateral spread\” attribute of Clo-Pla3. Short spacer length was assorted less than 0.01 meters per year, long spacer grow includes Clo-Pla3-classes 0.01-0.25 meters a year and longer. This translation of species into PFT resulted in a list of 86 PFTs that served as species pool for model initialization. </p>
